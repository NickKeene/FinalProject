# Ten Key Points of IP

### Addressing:
* Each device connected to a network is assigned a unique numerical label known as an IP address by P. IPv4 addresses have the format xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx, but IPv6 addresses have a more extended hexadecimal format.

### Routing:
* IP is in charge of routing data packets between network devices. Routers employ destination IP addresses to identify the best path for a packet via the network.

### Versioning:
* IP is divided into two versions: IPv4 and IPv6. Although IPv4 is the most extensively used, IPv6 was designed to solve the scarcity of IPv4 addresses.

### Packet Structure:
* For transmission, IP divides data into packets. Each packet has a header that includes the source and destination IP addresses, version information, and other control information.

### Connectionless:
* IP is a connectionless protocol, which means it does not require a dedicated connection before transmitting data. Each packet is treated independently, allowing for greater routing flexibility.

### Best Effort Delivery:
* IP provides "best-effort" delivery, meaning it does not guarantee the delivery of packets. It relies on higher-layer protocols (such as TCP) to ensure reliable data transmission.

### Subnetting:
* IP enables network subnets to be created, allowing for more effective organization and control of IP addresses within bigger networks.

### Static and Dynamic Addressing:
* IP addresses can be assigned statically (manually) or dynamically (automatically) using DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol), making network administration easier.

### IPv4 Address Exhaustion:
* IPv4 address exhaustion has resulted from the growing number of connected devices. IPv6 was introduced to solve this problem by providing a wider pool of unique addresses.

### Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP):
* IPv4 address exhaustion has resulted from the growing number of connected devices. IPv6 was introduced to solve this problem by providing a wider pool of unique addresses.
