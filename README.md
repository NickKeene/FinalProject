# Difference between TCP, UDP, and IP
### Author: en.wikipedia.org

## What to Expect
* **TCP** is a reliable, connection-oriented protocol that ensures ordered and error-checked data transmission. **UDP**, on the other hand, is a faster but less reliable, connectionless protocol suitable for applications where speed is prioritized over data integrity. **IP** is responsible for addressing and routing data packets within a network, assigning unique IP addresses to devices. TCP includes features such as error correction, flow control, and a three-way handshake for connection establishment. In contrast, UDP minimizes overhead, lacks handshaking, and provides best-effort delivery without guarantees of order or successful transmission.

## Target Audience
* Network Professionals: This group includes network administrators, system architects, and IT professionals who manage and optimize computer networks.

* Software Developers: This category includes programmers and software engineers that create networked applications that rely on fast data transmission.

* Students and Educators: Students studying computer science, information technology, or related subjects, as well as educators teaching networking courses, are catered to.

* Security Experts: Providing useful information for security professionals concerned with network communications security and cyber threat prevention.

* Individuals and Hobbyists: This section provides information for people who have a general interest in computer networking and technology, as well as a better grasp of data transfer via the internet.
